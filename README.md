# venmo_tweeter

This script pulls data from Venmo's public API and finds Venmo transactions that claim to be for drugs, sex or alcohol and then tweets about it.

The purpose of this project is not to shame or embarass anyone, that is why last names are removed. Instead I hope to demonstrate how much data is being made publicly available by the Venmo API and to encourage people to consider their privacy settings in Venmmo. By default all Venmo transactions are "public".
